/**
 * An experiment in building JSON views using case classes and companion
 * objects. Assuming that we had val observations = FooService.listAll: Seq[Observation],
 * we can get back a rendered JSON view by simply doing:
 *
 *   ObservationList(observations)
 *
 * This is handy, and works - we can render the output however we want, to trim
 * out (in this case) the ugly BSON object id, or get rid of the weight object
 * (as below) and go straight to obs.weight.grams. This is just an example to
 * try it out, in actuality we'd probably still want that Weight object in between.
 *
 * This code works fine, but it messes up the Swagger docs. If we specify the
 * output of the Swagger apiOperation as List[Observation], the output of course
 * looks nothing like what we get from this code. We'd need a way to pass this type
 * to Swagger and have it work, then we're golden here.
